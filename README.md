# University - Introduction To Programming (Java)

This is a repo for all Java programming projects
completed within my INTPROG module.

This module will contain:

1. All in-classes examples
2. Practical Session Code
3. Random "Boredom" files within ./Boredom/bin/
4. Coursework

There may be duplicate files of some classes, this is due to the topics being taught for a certain week. We may cover programming concepts that can be added to previous projects or that are needed for new teaching weeks :)
